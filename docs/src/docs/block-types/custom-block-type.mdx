# Get block type

You can find the block type of the currently focused or selected block. This is list of default
block types provided by `draft-js`. You can find the relevant utility for each one in the
documentation.

- unstyled
- header-1 to header-6
- unordered-list-item
- ordered-list-item
- blockquote
- code-block
- atomic

## getBlockType

To find out what is the type of the selected or focused block use `getBlockType` utility:

```ts
getBlockType(state: State) => string
```

## hasBlockTypeOf

The `hasBlockTypeOf` utility will check to see if the current block has the
type that you've passed to it or not. The returned value will be updated on
block changes.

```ts
hasBlockTypeOf(state: State, blockType: string) => boolean
```

This utility will be useful whenever you have a custom block type and need to
update the styles of the toggler button.

## Example

An example of `getBlockType` usage:

```ts
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { EditorState } from 'draft-js';
import { Editor, getBlockType, hasBlockTypeOf } from 'contenido';


const Demo = () => {
  const [editorState, setEditorState] = useState(
    EditorState.createEmpty()
  );

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log(getBlockType(editorState))
    console.log(hasBlockTypeOf(editorState, 'custom-block-type'))
  }, [editorState])

  return (
    <Editor
      editorState={editorState}
      onChange={setEditorState}
      editorRef={editorRef}
    >
  )
}

export default Demo;
```
