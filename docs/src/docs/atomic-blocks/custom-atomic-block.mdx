# addAtomicBlock

You can use atomic blocks in order to embed non-text content within your editor. The
atomic content is useful for usecases such as images, videos, audios, mentions, hashtags
and more.

## addAtomicBlock

The `addAtomicBlock` utility will add a non-text content in your editor.

```ts
addAtomicBlock(
  state: State,
  stateHandler: StateHandler,
  fileType: string,
  attributes?: Attributes,
  mutibility?: DraftEntityMutability
) => void
```

The `addImage`, `addVideo`, `addFile` or `addAudio` utilities are based on
addAtomicBlock above.
