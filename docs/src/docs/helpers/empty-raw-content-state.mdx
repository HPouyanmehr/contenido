# Empty raw content state

A raw content state that you can use to initialize an empty state in SSR.

## Usage

When you're implementing your editor with SSR (like [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js))
there could be some issues with the very first content state that you use
in your editor (The one that you create with `EditorState.createEmpty()`).
This commonly because of the key difference of the content state on the server
and the client side. To fix this issue and have a clean state in SSR you may need
to pass the very first content state with the same key on both server and client side.
The following constant is an empty and raw content state that you can easily store and pass
it to the editor as the first state

```ts
// Types
import type { RawDraftContentState } from 'draft-js';

const emptyRawContentState: RawDraftContentState = {
  entityMap: {},
  blocks: [
    {
      text: '',
      key: 'LG6AABOZOBAMJ',
      type: 'unstyled',
      entityRanges: [],
      depth: 0,
      inlineStyleRanges: [],
    },
  ],
};

export default emptyRawContentState;
```

## Example

An example of `emptyRawContentState` usage:

```ts
import { useState } from 'react';
import { EditorState } from 'draft-js';
import { Editor, emptyRawContentState } from 'contenido';

const emptyContentState = convertFromRaw(emptyRawContentState)

const Demo = () => {
  const [editorState, setEditorState] = useState(
    EditorState.createWithContent(emptyContentState)
  );

  return (
      <Editor
        editorState={editorState}
        onChange={setEditorState}
        editorRef={editorRef}
      >
  )
}

export default Demo;
```
