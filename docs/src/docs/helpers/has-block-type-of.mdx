# hasBlockTypeOf

To find out if the current content block has your desired block type, you
can use this function

## Usage

The `hasBlockTypeOf` utility will check to see if the current block has the
type that you've passed to it or not. The returned value will be updated on
block changes.

```ts
hasBlockTypeOf(state: State, blockType: string) => boolean
```

This utility will be useful whenever you have a custom block type and need to
update the styles of the toggler button.

## Example

An example of `hasBlockTypeOf` usage:

```ts
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { EditorState } from 'draft-js';
import { Editor, hasBlockTypeOf } from 'contenido';


const Demo = () => {
  const [editorState, setEditorState] = useState(
    EditorState.createEmpty()
  );

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log(hasBlockTypeOf(editorState, 'custom-block-type'))
  }, [editorState])

  return (
    <Editor
      editorState={editorState}
      onChange={setEditorState}
      editorRef={editorRef}
    >
  )
}

export default Demo;
```
