# Focus on the editor

There some cases that you need to return the user focus on the editor. For

```ts
focusOnEditor(ref: EditorRef) => void;
```

```ts
import { useState, useRef } from 'react';
import { EditorState } from 'draft-js';
import { Editor, focusOnEditor } from 'contenido';

const Demo = () => {
  const [editorState, setEditorState] = useState(EditorState.createEmpty());

  const editorRef = useRef(null);

  return (
    <>
      <Editor
        editorState={editorState}
        onChange={setEditorState}
        editorRef={editorRef}
      >
      <button
        onClick={() => focusOnEditor(editorRef)}
