# Button

Buttons allow _users_ to take actions, and **make** choices, with a single tap.

Buttons communicate actions that users can take. **_They_** are typically placed throughout your UI, in places like:

```ts
import Button from '@mui/material/button';

const X = () => {
  return <Button>Click Me</Button>;
};

export default X;
```

- Modal windows
  - Forms
- Cards
- Toolbars

## Basic Button

The `Button` comes with three variants: text (default), contained, and outlined.
