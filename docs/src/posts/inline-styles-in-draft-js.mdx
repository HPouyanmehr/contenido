## What is this post about?

This tutorial is about inline styles in draft-js and customizations for your editor. In this post, You will learn how to implement an
editor with basic and custom inline styles. This tutorial is helpful if you're new to draft-js and web editors or looking for a way to
implement an editor for your comment box or similar use cases.

- [Installation](#installation)

## <a name='requirements'></a> Requirements

To be able to create an editor, the only requirement is to know how to set up a ReactJS (or NextJs) project. We're going to use
[draft-js](https://draftjs.org/) and [contenido](https://contenidojs.com/) packages in this tutorial.

### <a name='darft-js'></a> Draft JS

Draft-js is a rich text editor framework for React. You can read [this post](https://www.contenidojs.com/blog/a-brief-introduction-of-draft-js)
to get familiar with that.

### <a name='contenido'></a> Contenido

Contenido is a library with a set of tools to help you create your rich text editor on top of draft-js. We use contenido to
boost the development process and avoid repetitive processes.

## <a name='installation'></a> Installation

First, we will install React and Typescript (There will be a JS alternative for everything, so stick with your favorite one).

```bash
# typescript
npx create-react-app draft-inline-styles --template typescript

# javascript
npx create-react-app draft-inline-styles
```

After the installation is done, install `draft-js` and `contenido` with this command:

```bash
# typescript
npm i draft-js @types/draft-js contenido@latest

# javascript
npm i draft-js  contenido@latest
```

## What is contenido?

Draft-js has a lot of potential that can make your work outstanding. However most of the time, its downsides persuade the developers to
choose another library for their project. As mentioned earlier, you may end up repeating yourself in a lot of similar situations and
that leads you to ask why should I use my time incorrectly like this? If you have some experience in Redux, the feeling can be the same.
Redux on its own is a really powerful state management library, But the efforts, the time, the repetition, and the complexity can make you
choose an alternative.

Contenido is something like `redux-toolkit` to `redux`. You can skip the repetitions and be out of the complexity, saving a lot of time for
your other tasks and have a clean sight of what you're doing.

As the [official documentation](https://www.contenidojs.com/docs/getting-started/overview) says:

> Contenido is a library with a set of tools to help you create your own editor on top of draft-js without thinking about
> how to handle things.

## Features of contenido

These are some of contenido's features. For each section you'll also have utilities to implement your desired style or functionality.

- Inline Styles (Bold, italic, underline , ...) + Customization
- Block Types (H1 to H6, OL, UL, Blockquote, ...) + Customization
- Insertion (Media and File, Link) + Customization
- Built-in Text Alignment
- Counters and Limitation utilities

To see the complete list of its utilities checkout this [page](https://www.contenidojs.com/docs/getting-started/overview).

## Why to use contenido?

`Contenido` will be your agent to handle stuff in building a rich react text editor. These are some of the key benefits of using
contenido with `draft-js`:

### Time Saver

Using contenido helps you save a lot of time. You don't need to write every single editor's behavior on yourself. In 99% of
situations there is a ready-to-use utility for you.

### Simplicity

The job is done for you in contenido, and there is no complexity to ruin your focus or coding principles.

### Light Weight and Tree Shakeable

Contenido is written in a modular way. Each utility has its module and there is no unusual connection between those modules which
leads to a very small import size.

### <a name='typescript'></a> Typescript

Contenido is written in typescript so unlike the draft-js you have the benefits of types as well.

### Compatible with UI Libs

If you choose a ready-to-use text editor (even if it's on top of the draft-js), you should accept the incompatible components' appearances
in your application. With contenido, you have the functionality and can completely mix it with your UI library like MUI, BootStrap,
Tailwind or even your UI principles.
