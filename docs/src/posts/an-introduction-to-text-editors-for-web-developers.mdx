In this post, we're going to get familiar with text editors and take a look at different approaches
for implementing editors on the web.

## What is a text editor?

Generally, a text editor is a program that lets the user edit text. Whenever you're able to type some
text in the input, you are editing the text, and that input is somehow a text editor. By this definition,
we can call the HTML input element a basic text editor. However, no one is going to use that as a text
editor. Here is a list of different types of text editors that we're going to check one by one:

- Basic Text Editors
- WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get)
- Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
- Code Editors
- Markup Language Editors

## Basic text editors

The simplest form of text editors is the basic one. In a basic text editor, you can create and edit plain
text without any styling or formatting. This type of editor will give you a lightweight method to make
notes, simple to-do lists, and other basic tasks. Here are some of the basic ones for different
platforms:

- TextEdit (Mac)
- Notepad (Windows)
- Nano (Linux)
- HTML `textarea` (Web)

## WYSIWYG

The WYSIWYG (wi·zee·wig) editors are visual editors that allow users to create and modify the
content using a GUI. As the name indicates, what you see in the text editor is as same as the final result.
So these sorts of editors are handy if you have to pay attention to both content and its display.

- Google Docs
- Microsoft word

## Integrated Development Environments

IDEs are some sort of special text editors that are designed for the programming and software development
purposes. Syntax highlighting, intelligence and code completion, version controlling and debugging are the
benefits of integrated development environments.

- Visual Studio
- Eclipse
- Jet Brains Products like PyCharm and WebStorm

## Code Editors

Just like IDEs, code editors are designed for programming and software development. The difference is that
these types of editors are lightweight, and they are generally for coding and editing source codes. Code editors
aren't that specific for just one or a few programming languages like IDEs. You'll have features
like syntax highlighting, code completion, and version controlling here as well.

- Visual Studio Code
- Atom
- Sublime Text

## Markup Language Editors

With these editors, you can create, edit, and manipulate documents written in markup languages like HTML, XML,
Markdown, or LaTeX. Markup language editors use special symbols or tags to define the format and structure of
a document. This sort of editor also comes with features like syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and validation.

- StackEdit, a Markdown editor
- Overleaf, a LaTeX editor

## Online Text Editing

These days almost everything is online or going to become online and cloud base. So, traditional editors
where you need to install on your device are fading out. Users prefer to have the whole pack of tools in one
place, and shifting between software is getting less common. If your job or interests are related to online
services, you may need a correct approach to managing your content and service.

It depends on the needs of the editor to choose the correct type for your application but generally
implementing online IDEs and code editors is much more difficult than the other types. So, If you need an IDE
or a lightweight code editor in your application, you can use integrations with some ready-to-use online editors
like CodeSandbox.

Basic editors, where you need neither styling nor formatting, can be easily implemented by `textarea` in HTML.
Also, if your needs are about a markup language editor and you need to have a custom look editor, you can choose
between 3rd party libraries or implementing the whole editor by yourself based on your time and budget.

WYSIWYG editors are the most common editor type in online applications as they can fulfill a wide range
of tasks and needs, also they're available in GUI (Graphical User Interface) so they're easy to use. The
approach you choose, if you need a WYSIWYG editor, depends on your time and budget as well as the project stack.
Implementing a rich text editor from zero may be time-consuming and buggy at first in most cases because you need
to support different browsers as well as OSs (Operation Systems). So it's a better approach to choose a library
available out there that gives you the basic set of utils and tools to create your own.

## Common Issues In Building WYSIWYG Text Editors

If you're going to add a rich text editor to your app, here are the most common issues and limitations:

- Styling and customization are limited to simple stuff like color or background color
- Repetitive utilities need to be implemented in most cases on your own
- The editor can't follow your UI principles that well

## Conclusion

So we discussed the text editor definition and different types of it. The best approach for you depends on
your needs. Here is a comparison table of different online editor types:

| Editor Type             | Examples        | Tips                                                                            |
| ----------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Basic Editor            | HTML `textarea` | Simple implementation, Customizable, No need to 3rd party libs                  |
| WYSIWYG                 | Google Docs     | Customization needs efforts, Creating everything from ground takes so much time |
| IDEs                    | StackBlitz      | It's better to integrate with available options                                 |
| Code Editor             | CodePen         | It's better to integrate with available options                                 |
| Markup Language Editors | StackEdit       | Time-consuming if you wanna build it on yourself                                |
